# sparta-json-parsing


In this repo I created a template for integration testing using using Object orientated model. This repo was used to learn how to parse json into ruby and I wrote an integration framework to do blackbox testing.

### How to run the tests

clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:katiefrost95/sparta-json-parsing.git`

Make sure you require the correct gems and run rspec.

 `rspec --init`

 `require json`

 To run the tests in your terminal run the command rspec and watch the tests run.
